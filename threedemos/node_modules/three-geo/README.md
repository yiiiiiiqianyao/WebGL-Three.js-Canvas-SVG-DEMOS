# three-geo

**three-geo** is a [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) based geographic visualization library. Using three-geo, we can easily build satellite-textured 3D terrain models in near real-time by simply specifying GPS coordinates anywhere on the globe. The geometry of the terrain is based on the RGB-encoded DEM (Digital Elevation Model) provided by the Mapbox Maps API.

The terrain is represented by standard [THREE.Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh) objects. This makes it easy for us to access underlying geometry/texture array and perform original GIS (Geographic Information System) experiments in JavaScript. (See Usage for how to programatically obtain those mesh objects).

This demo app includes features such as

- on-demand 3D terrain building (by a mouse click on the Leaflet map),
- real-time camera projection onto Leaflet (with oritentaion and HFoV indication),
- terrain interaction with a VR-like laser beam,
- measuring Euclidean distances between terrain points,
- auto camera orbiting around the custom z-axis.

## Setup

**Installation**

```
$ npm i three-geo
```

**Loading**

Script tag: use `ThreeGeo` after

```
<script src="dist/three-geo.min.js"></script>
```

ES6:

```
import ThreeGeo from 'dist/three-geo.esm.js';
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to build a geographic terrain located at GPS coordinates (46.5763, 7.9904) in a 5 km radius circle. The terrain's satellite zoom resolution is set to 12. (The highest zoom value supported is 17.)

For standalone tests, use **examples/simple-viewer** ([source code](https://github.com/w3reality/three-geo/tree/master/examples/simple-viewer)).

```js
const tgeo = new ThreeGeo({
    tokenMapbox: '********', // <---- set your Mapbox API token here
});

const terrain = await tgeo.getTerrainRgb(
    [46.5763, 7.9904], // [lat, lng]
    5.0,               // radius of bounding circle (km)
    12);               // zoom resolution

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
scene.add(terrain);

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas });
renderer.render(scene, camera);
```

## API

In this section, we list `three-geo`'s public API methods, where `origin`, `radius`, and `zoom` are parameters common to them:

  - `origin` **Array\<number\>** Center of the terrain represented as GPS coordinates `[latitude, longitude]`.

  - `radius` **number** Radius of the circle that fits the terrain.

  - `zoom` **number (integer)** Satellite zoom resolution of the tiles in the terrain. Select from {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}, where 17 is the highest value supported. For a fixed radius, higher zoom resolution results in more tileset API calls.


`ThreeGeo`

- `constructor(opts={})`

  Create a ThreeGeo instance with parameters.

  - `opts.tokenMapbox`=\"\" **string** Mapbox API token. This must be provided.

  - `opts.unitsSide`=1.0 **number** The side length of the square that fits the terrain in WebGL space.

- `async getTerrainRgb(origin, radius, zoom)` [ Added in v1.4 ]

  Return a **THREE.Group** object that represents a 3D surface of the terrain.

  The group object contains an **Array\<THREE.Mesh\>** as `.children`. Each mesh corresponds to a partial geometry of the terrain textured with satellite images.

- `async getTerrainVector(origin, radius, zoom)` [ Added in v1.4 ]

  Return a **THREE.Group** object that represents a 3D contour map of the terrain.

  The group object contains an **Array\<THREE.Object3D\>** as `.children`. Each child object is either an extruded **THREE.Mesh** with `.name` attribute prefixed by `dem-vec-shade-<ele>-`, or a **THREE.Line** with `.name` prefixed by `dem-vec-line-<ele>-` (`<ele>` is the height of each contour in meters).

- `getProjection(origin, radius, unitsSide=1.0)` [ [Example](#ex-proj) ]

  Return an object `{ proj, projInv, bbox, unitsPerMeter }` that includes transformation-related functions and parameters, where

  - `proj(latlng)` is a function that maps geo coordinates `latlng` (an array `[lat, lng]`) to WebGL coordinates `[x, y]`.

  - `projInv(x, y)` is a function that maps WebGL coordinates `[x, y]` to geo coordinates `[lat, lng]`.

  - `bbox` is an array `[w, s, e, n]` that represents the computed bounding box of the terrain, where `w` (West) and `e` (East) are longitudinal limits; and `s` (South) and `n` (North) are latitudinal limits.

  - `unitsPerMeter` is the length in WebGL-space per meter.

<p><details>
<summary>Legacy callback based API</summary>

- `getTerrain(origin, radius, zoom, callbacks={})`

  - `callbacks.onRgbDem` **function (meshes) {}** Implement this to request the geometry of the terrain. Called when the entire terrain\'s geometry is obtained.

    - `meshes` **Array\<THREE.Mesh\>** All the meshes belonging to the terrain.

  - `callbacks.onSatelliteMat` **function (mesh) {}** Implement this to request the satellite textures of the terrain. Called when the satellite texture of each mesh belonging to the terrain is obtained.

    - `mesh` **THREE.Mesh** One of the meshes that's part of the terrain.

  - `callbacks.onVectorDem` **function (objs) {}** Implement this to request the contour map of the terrain. Called when the contour map of the terrain is obtained.

    - `objs` **Array\<THREE.Object3D\>** Extruded meshes (**THREE.Mesh** objects with `.name` attribute prefixed by `dem-vec-shade-<ele>-`) and lines (**THREE.Line** objects with `.name` attribute prefixed by `dem-vec-line-<ele>-`), where `<ele>` is the height of each contour in meters.
